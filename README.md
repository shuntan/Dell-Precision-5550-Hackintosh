| ~~**Multiple displays via Thunderbolt Dock**~~ | ~~Not done yet because of missing Thunderbolt Dock~~ Tested with a Dell WD19TB Thunderbolt Dock. I made some adjustments to the WEG framebuffer patches to enable two displays via Thunderbolt. | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Battery reading**                            | Buggy or not updating from time to time when external displays connected | ‚ùå No  |
| ~~**Thunderbolt fix**~~                        | ~~Flashing Apple's Original Thunderbolt Firmware to the Titan Ridge 2C 2018 SPI EEPROM~~ (Not needed, as everything works fine) |       |
| ~~**Disable CFG Lock**~~                       | ~~Flashing a modded UEFI/BIOS because this option is not listed in the Dell Utility and changes via GRUB setup-var are not working because the EFI writable flag is not set~~ (see section [Adjust UEFI variables](https://github.com/MokkaSchnalle/macOS-Dell-5411-5511#adjust-uefi-variables-to-enable-4k60hz-and-disable-cfg-lock)) | ‚úÖ Yes |

## üñ• Installation

### BIOS/UEFI settings

- Secure Boot: Off (Default: On)
- SATA Mode: AHCI (Default: RAID) (Also includes NVMe drives! macOS will not see any drives when using RAID mode)
- Intel SGX: Software Controlled or Off
- Thunderbolt Configuration: No Security

### Adjust UEFI variables to enable 4K@60Hz and disable CFG lock

Needed tools: **grub-mod-setup_var** on a FAT32 USB-Stick or on the OpenCore EFI
**Dell_PFS_Extract**, **UEFITool_NE_A58**, **Ifrextractor** (They are all available for both macOS and Windows).

You can adjust **all UEFI settings** even if the BIOS is password protected as long as booting from external media is allowed and/or SecureBoot is disabled to load the .efi.

My Dell BIOS is version 1.2.15. **Always dump the correct files for your own BIOS version!**

1. Download your BIOS flash program via Dell (search for your model, then click `Drivers and Downloads` and filter for `BIOS`)
2. Dell_PFS_Extract: Select folder containing your Dell .exe file (This will extract the raw BIOS .bin file)
3. UEFITool_NE_A58: Open `1 System BIOS with BIOS Guard vx.x.x.bin` and export the `Setup` IFR section
4. Ifrextractor: Use `Section_PE32_image_Setup.sct` as input file and write output to `Section_PE32_image_Setup IFR.txt`
5. Find variables by their name in the .txt file via Ctrl + F (e.g. DVMT or CFG or Thunderbolt)

The line should be something like this: `One Of: DVMT Pre-Allocated, VarStoreInfo (VarOffset/VarName): 0xF5, VarStore: 0x16` For some BIOS versions (including mine) the variable is not in `VarStore: 0x1` (Setup). If so, find your correct VarStore at the beginning of the .txt file.

For me it's `VarStore: VarStoreId: 0x16 [72C5E28C-7783-43A1-8767-FAD73FCCAFA4], Size: 0x318, Name: SaSetup` (`SaSetup` instead of `Setup`).

We do the same for the CFG lock: `One Of: CFG Lock, VarStoreInfo (VarOffset/VarName): 0x3E, VarStore: 0x11`
`VarStore 0x11` is `CpuSetup`.

**With the new information we are able to build our commands to adjust these variables:**
`setup_var_cv SaSetup 0xF5 0x2` (0x2 = 64M, default = 32M)
`setup_var_cv CpuSetup 0x3E 0x0` (0x0 = off, default = on)
Boot your computer and start a UEFI shell via OpenCore. Then start `grub-mod-setup_var` and run your commands.

Reboot your computer and check.

### Create a bootable installer

Grab a free USB stick with at least 16GiB and format it with HFS+ file system and GUID table.

Download a legal copy of macOS from the App Store using a real Mac and create a bootable installation stick: `sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Big\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume` Rename MyVolume to your USB stick name or drag the Volume into the Terminal window.

Now use the tool `MountEFI` to mount the EFI volume on the USB stick.

### Configuring EFI

Clone this repository to get the base EFI folder. Copy the folder into the EFI partition you have mounted in the previous step.

## üõ† Configuration

This section talks about configuring the EFI folder for your exact hardware. Almost all changes are done inside the OpenCore configuration file. Use the provided version of [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) to edit `EFI/OC/config.plist`.

### üåê Wi-Fi/Bluetooth

The stock Intel Wi-Fi cards are still unstable in macOS. So to use Wi-Fi with "AirPort feeling", you will have to replace it for a supported card. This repo is configured to work out-of-the-box with many Dell Broadcom adapters (cheap on Ebay).

### üñ•Ô∏è Display

You should enable subpixel antialiasing for non-retina screens with this command: `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO` In addition, 5550 (15") users can use SwitchResX to create a custom HiDPI resolution to get greater screen rendering. FHD with 15" is quite small.

### üåô Sleep

If you are facing random wakeups while the lid is closed, apply the following settings:

```
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
sudo pmset -a standby 0
sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0
sudo pmset -a powernap 0
```

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance

CPU power management is done by `CPUFriend.kext` while `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext` defines how it should be done. `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext` is generated for a specific CPU and power setting. The one supplied in this repository was made for the Intel Core i7-10850H and is optimized for optimized performance (like on normal MacBook Pro's). In case you have another CPU or would rather sacrifice some performance in trade for more battery life, you can use the script in the `Tools` folder to generate your own `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext`.

Keep in mind that the fan used in the Latitude 5411 and 5511 is really bad. I used the tool "Macs Fan Control" to muzzle this turbine.

## ‚öΩ Conclusion

I am using this computer for my everyday work without any issues, crashes etc. For me it is the best Hackintosh experience so far on a laptop. Feel free to add improvements via PR and report issues üôÇ

Happy hacking!
